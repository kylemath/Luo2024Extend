as someone who has tried to used ai to help me write proofs, this has pretty much been my universal experience with it. with very simple tasks (compute this algebraic expression for me) it does wonderfully. it’s also really good at typesetting. but there are difficulties.

even in the screenshot there’s an error—our definition of monotonicity only works for one dimensional states and actions, which the “lifting” technique here obviates; but there are several more. i’ve found asking AI to try to prove things autonomously has actually slowed me down

bc it will generate things that *look* so good that you want to believe them before you spend a little longer looking at them. for what its worth, a technique to this (find the right “http://i.id.-ificiation of the markov state” ) is a natural first guess, but fails

one core reason is that short-run player beliefs depend on both \alpha_0 and s_1; in the i.i.d. case, we define the nash correspondence B(s_1) as an object on \Delta(A_0) times \Delta(A_2), and use payoffs to discipline the set jointly.

you then need to write B(s_1, µ_0) as a function of player 2’s belief about theta and also s_1, which will affect their best reply. but this makes it impossible to get just deviations of the form we consider to work, since µ_0 will constantly be changing.

the problem is that player 2’s belief depends on the action and the state realization as a pair now, and there is persistence —- this is why Pei (2020) requires additional assumptions than us; not just because of perfect persistence.

the draft posted makes several other smaller errors, too, which were easy to catch on a first read—-glaring enough to someone who is an expert on the paper, but maybe just subtle enough to pass scrutiny by most other people. that’s concerning for the future of “AI slop”

To make it clear: suppose s_1 just takes an action that reveals the state. In the iid case, this won’t affect SR beliefs. But in the Markov case, this can cause beliefs to never settle into the stationary distribution.
