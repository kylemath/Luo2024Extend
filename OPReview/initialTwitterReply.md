thanks for this! its very nicely written nonsense upon a first skim. the key "lifting construction" doesn't seem to make much sense: in particular, remark 2.6 remains the same without the lifting construction (all ergodic distributions have fixed stationary distributions)

its also not clear why you want payoffs to depend on the entire lifted state---this is certainly not the case in the framework that we consider! so bernoulli payoffs here are confusing

remark 3.3 is also confusing---i'm not quite sure what it means. we know that NBC is generically satisfied in exogenous alpha_0 games, as the document you've written implicitly assumes---so how does it get easiesr to satisfy?

the claim "the only place where i.i.d. is used is lemma 3" is also incorrect and the fatal flaw of the proof attempt --- we also use it to discipline SR player information sets about the state, because the public signal now has autocorrelation that influences SR player BR

in fact the stackelberg strategy need not even be completely well-defined: to see this, consider a persuasion example where the prior can move between regions where different concavifications are optimal

in particular, i.i.d. helps ensure that this object is well-defined :) otherwise, it would depend on the prior belief given the history, and you'd see B_\eta(s_1^*, h^t, \sigma), which complicates the analysis substantially

 is willing to gift me one i'll post the refine review of the analysis as well. otherwise i'll take a much closer look at the analysis tomorrow and write something up (as a human) about where things fail

@danielluo_pi
tl;dr everything is very prettily done (from a typesetting/aesthetic perspective) and that is impressive. but there's several major flaws in the analysis, and gratuitous remarks that don't make sense even upon a quick first skim

I know nothing about the subject, but your response to this crazy assertion has made my day! 😃
