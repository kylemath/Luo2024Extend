# Subplan B: Point-by-Point Response Letter

## All 15 Points from Daniel Luo

### Reply Thread (R1–R7)
R1. "nicely written nonsense" — overall dismissal
R2. Lifting construction doesn't make sense / Remark 2.6 superfluous
R3. Payoffs depending on entire lifted state is unmotivated
R4. Remark 3.3 (easier NBC) is confusing/meaningless
R5. **FATAL:** "only place i.i.d. is used is Lemma 3" is incorrect — SR info sets
R6. Stackelberg strategy may not be well-defined (persuasion/concavification)
R7. B_η(s₁*, h^t, σ) depends on history — i.i.d. ensures it's well-defined

### Quote-Tweet Thread (Q1–Q8)
Q1. AI generates things that look good but are wrong
Q2. Monotonicity only works for 1D states/actions — lifting breaks it
Q3. "i.i.d.-ification of Markov state" is natural first guess but fails
Q4. SR beliefs depend on both α₀ and s₁; B(s₁) on Δ(A₀)×Δ(A₂)
Q5. Need B(s₁, μ₀) as function of player 2's belief about θ AND s₁
Q6. Player 2's belief depends on (action, state) pair + persistence → Pei extra assumptions
Q7. Several smaller errors, easy to catch for expert — "AI slop"
Q8. State-revealing strategy: Markov beliefs never settle into stationary
