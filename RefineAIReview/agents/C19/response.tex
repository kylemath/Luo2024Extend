\subsection*{Comment C19 (LOW): Imprecise Terminology Regarding Filter Stability}

\textbf{Reviewer comment.} ``Initial condition of the Markov chain is `forgotten' exponentially fast'' reads as if referring to $\theta_0$ (chain mixing) rather than $\pi_0$ (prior forgetting). Proposition~A.2 is about the filter's dependence on the initial prior.

\medskip
\textbf{Disposition: Fully accepted.}

\medskip
\textbf{Response.} The reviewer correctly notes that the phrasing is ambiguous. Proposition~A.2 establishes filter stability:
\[
    \sup_{\pi_0, \pi_0'} \|\pi_t - \pi_t'\| \leq C \cdot \lambda^t,
\]
which concerns the \emph{filter's} dependence on its initial \emph{prior}~$\pi_0$, not the Markov chain's dependence on its initial \emph{state}~$\theta_0$. These are related but distinct properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chain mixing}: $\|P(\theta_t \in \cdot \mid \theta_0) - \pi\| \leq C' \lambda'^t$ --- the marginal distribution of $\theta_t$ forgets the initial state~$\theta_0$.
    \item \textbf{Filter stability}: $\sup_{\pi_0,\pi_0'}\|\pi_t - \pi_t'\| \leq C\lambda^t$ --- the filter (posterior over $\theta_t$ given observations) forgets its initial prior~$\pi_0$.
\end{itemize}

We have replaced ``initial condition of the Markov chain'' with ``initial prior of the filter'' and added a parenthetical distinguishing the two concepts. The follow-up clause has also been tightened to clarify that filter stability ensures the filter's predictions are insensitive to initialization, not that the signal distribution itself changes.

\medskip
\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Appendix~A.2: Replaced ``initial condition of the Markov chain is `forgotten' '' with ``initial prior of the filter is forgotten,'' and added parenthetical distinguishing filter stability from chain mixing.
\end{itemize}
