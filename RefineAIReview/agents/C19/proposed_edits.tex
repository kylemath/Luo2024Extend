% CURRENT TEXT (line 36):
% This ensures that the initial condition of the Markov chain is ``forgotten''
% exponentially fast, so the per-period signal distribution converges to a limit
% determined by the observation process alone---the key property used in Step~3
% of the proof.

% REPLACEMENT TEXT:
This ensures that the filter's dependence on its initial prior $\pi_0$ is ``forgotten'' exponentially fast: regardless of the prior $\pi_0$ used to initialize the Bayesian filter, the posterior $\pi_t(\cdot | y_0, \ldots, y_t)$ converges to the same limit, so the filter's predictions become insensitive to initialization. (This is distinct from \emph{chain mixing}, which concerns the Markov chain's marginal distribution $P(\theta_t \in \cdot)$ forgetting the initial \emph{state}~$\theta_0$; filter stability concerns the filter forgetting the initial \emph{prior}~$\pi_0$.) This prior-forgetting property is used in Step~3 of the proof.
