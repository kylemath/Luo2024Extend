% OLD (line 41 in context):
The first is that \emph{temporal patterns serve as an identification channel}. With persistent states, actions exhibit autocorrelation. A conditional strategy (``fight when detecting an attack'') produces different sequential patterns than an unconditional strategy (``fight 50\% of the time''), even when per-period frequencies match. Persistence thus strengthens identification, making confound-defeating conditions easier to satisfy in the supermodular case.
