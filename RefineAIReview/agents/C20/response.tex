% ---- Response to Comment C20: Missing discussion of Stackelberg well-definedness ----

\textbf{Comment C20 (MEDIUM):} \emph{Section~9.5 says Stackelberg well-definedness for persuasion games is ``acknowledged as an open question in Section~10.'' But Section~10.2 doesn't mention it. Need to either add it to Section~10.2 or fix the cross-reference.}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Response:} The reviewer has identified a genuine cross-reference error. Section~9.5 claims the issue is discussed in Section~10, but Section~10.2 omits it. We have added a new paragraph to Section~10.2 addressing Stackelberg well-definedness for persuasion games as an open question:

\begin{quote}
For \textbf{persuasion games}, the Stackelberg strategy is defined via Bayesian persuasion (concavification of the sender's value function). Under Markov dynamics, the receiver's prior varies across states via the filtering distribution $F(\cdot|\theta)$, and the optimal persuasion scheme may differ for each prior. Whether a single state-independent Stackelberg strategy exists that is simultaneously optimal across all filtering priors, or whether the Stackelberg strategy must itself be state-contingent, remains open. This issue, first raised by Luo (2026), is specific to games where the commitment strategy solves an optimization over belief distributions rather than over actions directly.
\end{quote}

\noindent This ensures the cross-reference in Section~9.5 is accurate and the open question is properly documented.
