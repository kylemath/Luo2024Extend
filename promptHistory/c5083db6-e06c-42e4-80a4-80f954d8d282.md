## The Main Result of the Paper

**"Marginal Reputation"** by Luo and Wolitzky (2024) studies reputation formation in repeated games where a long-run player (player 1) observes a **private signal** (e.g., a state \(\theta\) or signal \(y_0\)) before choosing an action, but short-run opponents only observe the **marginal distribution over actions** -- not the signal the long-run player conditioned on.

### The Core Problem

The classic Fudenberg-Levine (1989, 1992) reputation result says: if short-run players can observe the long-run player's full strategy (mapping from signals to actions), then a patient long-run player can secure her **Stackelberg (best commitment) payoff**. But in this paper's setting, the signal is *private*. Short-run players see *what* the long-run player did, but not *why*. For example, if the long-run player fights 50% of the time:

- She might be playing the smart Stackelberg strategy "fight when I detect an attack" (with attacks happening 50% of the time), **or**
- She might be randomly fighting 50% of the time regardless of the signal.

Both produce the identical observable marginal. The existing Fudenberg-Levine bounds become vacuous because the set of "0-confirmed best responses" is too large.

### The Main Result (Theorem 1)

**If the Stackelberg strategy \(s_1^*\) is *confound-defeating* and not behaviorally confounded, then:**

\[
\liminf_{\delta \to 1} \underline{U}_1(\delta) \geq V(s_1^*)
\]

That is, a patient long-run player secures at least her Stackelberg commitment payoff \(V(s_1^*)\) in every Nash equilibrium.

A strategy is **confound-defeating** if: for any best response of the short-run players, the joint distribution \(\gamma(\alpha_0, s_1^*)\) over (signal, action) is the **unique** solution to the optimal transport problem of maximizing the long-run player's payoff subject to the given marginals over signals and actions. Equivalently, the support of the induced joint distribution satisfies **strict cyclical monotonicity**.

In the one-dimensional supermodular case, this simplifies: a strategy is confound-defeating **if and only if it is monotone** (higher signal \(\to\) weakly higher action).

### The Critical Assumption: States are i.i.d.

Throughout the paper, the private signal/state \(\theta\) (or \(y_0\)) is drawn **i.i.d. across periods**. This assumption is used deeply in the proof:

1. **Commitment types play the same \(s_1\) every period** -- this is meaningful because the stage game is the same each period (since \(\theta\) is i.i.d., the distribution of \(\theta\) is the same every period).
2. **The statistical identification argument** (Lemmas 2-3) relies on the fact that the signal distribution \(\rho(y_0)\) is fixed over time, so the induced signal distribution \(p(\alpha_0, s_1, \alpha_2)\) from playing \(s_1\) is the same each period. This makes the martingale convergence and counting arguments work cleanly.
3. **The optimal transport characterization** compares strategies with the same marginal over actions. When \(\theta\) is i.i.d., the marginal over \(\theta\) is the same exogenous object each period, making the transport problem well-defined and stationary.

The paper notes (footnote 9/p.9) that **Pei (2020) studies the case where \(\theta\) is *perfectly persistent*** (drawn once and fixed forever) and finds broadly similar supermodular/submodular distinctions, but under different conditions and arguments.

---

## Five Interpretations of "Allow for Persistent/Markovian States"

The task asks about extending the main result to the case where the state \(\theta_t\) follows a **Markov chain** rather than being i.i.d. Below are five interpretations of what this means and proposed tests for each.

---

### Interpretation 1: The State Follows a Stationary, Ergodic Markov Chain

**What it means:** Instead of \(\theta_t \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \rho\), the state evolves as \(\theta_t | \theta_{t-1} \sim F(\cdot | \theta_{t-1})\) where \(F\) is a stationary ergodic Markov kernel. The long-run player still observes \(\theta_t\) privately each period and plays \(s_1(\theta_t)\). This is the most natural generalization -- it nests i.i.d. as a special case (when \(F\) is independent of \(\theta_{t-1}\)).

**Why it's nontrivial:** The key issue is that the signal distribution is no longer the same each period -- it depends on the previous (unobserved) state. A commitment type playing \(s_1\) every period now induces *different* marginals over actions in different periods (conditional on the Markov state). The optimal transport problem becomes period-dependent, and the statistical identification arguments (Lemmas 2-3) that count "distinguishing periods" need modification because the signal distributions are non-stationary from the short-run players' perspective.

**Proposed test:** Verify whether the proof of Theorem 1 survives when:
- The counting argument (Lemma 2) is replaced with an ergodic theorem bound: show that the expected number of periods where \(h_t \notin H_t^\eta\) is still bounded (now using the ergodic theorem for Markov chains rather than i.i.d. KL divergence bounds).
- The optimal transport problem \(\text{OT}(\rho(\alpha_0), \phi(\alpha_0, s_1^*); \alpha_2)\) is replaced with a *time-averaged* version over the stationary distribution of \(\theta\).
- **Concrete check:** Take the deterrence game (Section 2.1) with a Markov chain on \(\{C, D\}\) with persistence parameter \(q \in (0,1)\) (probability of staying in the same state). Compute the 0-confirmed best response set and check if confound-defeatingness still implies the Stackelberg bound.

---

### Interpretation 2: The Commitment Type's Strategy Becomes State-Dependent (Markov Strategies)

**What it means:** With persistent states, a commitment type might reasonably play a **Markov strategy** \(s_1(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\) or \(s_1(\theta_t, h_t^{\text{private}})\) that conditions on the current state *and* something about the history of past states (which the long-run player has observed). In the i.i.d. case, conditioning on past states is irrelevant because they carry no information about the current state. With Markov states, past states are informative, so a richer strategy space becomes natural.

**Why it's nontrivial:** The set of commitment types must be redefined. If commitment types can condition on the full history of private states, the strategy space is infinite-dimensional and the "confound-defeating" condition must be reformulated. The optimal transport problem becomes one over *sequences* of (signal, action) pairs rather than single-period pairs.

**Proposed test:**
- Restrict to **Markov commitment types** that condition only on \((\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\) -- a finite-dimensional strategy. Define confound-defeatingness for such strategies: the joint distribution \(\gamma\) over \((\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_{1,t})\) should uniquely solve the corresponding OT problem.
- Check whether the cyclical monotonicity characterization extends: is a Markov strategy confound-defeating iff its support in the \((\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}) \times A_1\) space is strictly cyclically monotone?
- **Concrete check:** In the trust game (Section 2.2), let \(\theta\) follow a two-state Markov chain. Define the Stackelberg Markov strategy as \(s_1^*(G, G) = H\), \(s_1^*(B, B) = L\), etc. Verify whether this strategy uniquely solves the extended OT problem.

---

### Interpretation 3: Short-Run Players Can Infer State Persistence from Action Patterns

**What it means:** When states are Markov, the *sequence* of the long-run player's actions carries information about state persistence, even though individual states are unobserved. For example, if the long-run player fights in consecutive periods, this is more likely if the state (attack) is persistent than if attacks are i.i.d. This creates a new identification channel that does not exist under i.i.d.

**Why it's nontrivial:** This could either *help* or *hurt* reputation formation. On one hand, autocorrelation in actions gives short-run players more information to distinguish the Stackelberg strategy from alternatives (potentially making confound-defeatingness easier to satisfy). On the other hand, it creates new confounding strategies: a commitment type could exploit the persistence pattern to mimic the Stackelberg action sequence without actually responding to states.

**Proposed test:**
- Formally characterize "sequential confound-defeatingness": the commitment strategy is confound-defeating not just in single-period marginals but in *joint distributions over consecutive action pairs* \((a_{1,t}, a_{1,t+1})\).
- **Concrete check:** In the deterrence game with Markov attacks (persistence \(q\)), compute the autocorrelation of the Stackelberg strategy's actions. Show that the set of strategies matching both the marginal *and* the autocorrelation of actions is smaller than the set matching only the marginal. If this set collapses to the Stackelberg strategy alone, confound-defeatingness holds for "free" under persistence.
- Test the conjecture: for sufficiently strong persistence (\(q\) close to 1), the sequential identification channel may make reputation formation *easier* than in the i.i.d. case.

---

### Interpretation 4: The Long-Run Player's Payoff Depends on Past States (Inter-Temporal Payoff Linkages)

**What it means:** With Markovian states, it is natural that the long-run player's stage payoff depends on both the current state and the previous state: \(u_1(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_{1,t}, a_{2,t})\). For instance, a chef's payoff today might depend on whether yesterday's fish was also fresh (repeat customers remember). This creates dynamic complementarities absent in the i.i.d. model.

**Why it's nontrivial:** The supermodularity condition (which simplifies confound-defeatingness to monotonicity) now involves a higher-dimensional object. Supermodularity in \((\theta_t, a_{1,t})\) alone may not suffice; one may also need conditions on how payoffs interact across time (e.g., supermodularity in \((\theta_{t-1}, a_{1,t})\) or \((\theta_t, a_{1,t-1})\)).

**Proposed test:**
- Extend Proposition 7 (supermodular case) to the Markov setting: define supermodularity over the expanded state \((\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\) and check if monotonicity in this expanded state characterizes confound-defeatingness.
- **Concrete check:** In the trust game, let the long-run player's payoff when state transitions from \(G\) to \(B\) differ from \(B\) to \(B\). Compute the commitment payoff under a monotone Markov strategy and verify whether the Theorem 1 bound extends.
- Identify the critical threshold: how much cross-period payoff dependence can be tolerated before confound-defeatingness breaks down?

---

### Interpretation 5: Replacing the Counting/KL-Divergence Bound with a Markov Mixing-Time Bound

**What it means:** This is the most technically precise interpretation. The proof of Theorem 1 relies on **Lemma 2**, which bounds the expected number of "distinguishing periods" (where the Stackelberg deviation's signal distribution differs from the equilibrium distribution) using a KL-divergence argument. Under i.i.d. states, this bound is \(\bar{T}(\eta, \mu_0) = -2\log\mu_0(\omega_{s_1^*}) / \eta^2\). With Markov states, the per-period KL divergence between commitment play and equilibrium play is no longer constant -- it depends on the Markov state. The question is whether a similar finite bound exists using the **mixing time** of the Markov chain.

**Why it's nontrivial:** If the Markov chain mixes slowly (high persistence), the effective number of "independent observations" the short-run players get is reduced. The bound \(\bar{T}\) must be inflated by a factor related to the mixing time \(\tau_{\text{mix}}\). If \(\tau_{\text{mix}}\) is finite, the bound is still finite (and the result should go through). If the chain is absorbing or has mixing time \(\to \infty\), the result could fail.

**Proposed test:**
- Rederive Lemma 2 using the ergodic theorem for Markov chains: the expected number of distinguishing periods should be bounded by something like \(\bar{T}(\eta, \mu_0) \cdot \tau_{\text{mix}}\), where \(\tau_{\text{mix}}\) is the mixing time of the Markov chain on \(\theta\).
- **Concrete check:** Parametrize the Markov chain by persistence \(q\). Verify that:
  - When \(q = 1/|\Theta|\) (i.i.d.), the bound recovers the original.
  - When \(q \to 1\) (perfectly persistent), the bound diverges, consistent with Pei (2020) requiring additional conditions.
  - For intermediate \(q\), the bound is finite and scales as \(1/(1-q)\).
- This would establish the result for all **ergodic** Markov chains and clearly delineate the boundary where it fails (non-ergodic/absorbing chains, connecting to Pei's perfectly persistent case).

### Summary Table

| # | Interpretation | Key Difficulty | Proposed Test |
|---|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Stationary ergodic Markov chain on \(\theta\) | Non-stationary signal distributions | Replace KL bound with ergodic theorem; check deterrence game with Markov attacks |
| 2 | Commitment types play Markov strategies | Infinite-dimensional strategy space | Restrict to one-step Markov strategies; extend OT and cyclical monotonicity |
| 3 | Action autocorrelation as new identification channel | Persistence helps or hurts? | Characterize "sequential confound-defeatingness"; compute autocorrelation signatures |
| 4 | Payoffs depend on past states | Higher-dimensional supermodularity | Extend Proposition 7 to expanded state space; identify tolerance threshold |
| 5 | Mixing-time correction to the statistical bound | Slow mixing inflates the bound | Rederive Lemma 2 with mixing-time factor; parametrize by persistence \(q\) |

The most likely intended meaning of the task is a combination of **Interpretations 1 and 5**: the state \(\theta_t\) follows a Markov chain rather than being i.i.d., and the question is whether the main statistical argument (the KL-divergence/martingale convergence machinery) and the optimal transport characterization can be adapted. The suspicion that "it is possible but was never done" is consistent with the fact that all the key ingredients -- ergodic theorems for Markov chains, optimal transport, martingale convergence -- have well-known analogues in the Markov setting, but the technical details of threading them through the proof of Theorem 1 have not been carried out.

</user_query>

assistant:
[Thinking] The user is asking about Interpretation 4 — extending the main result to allow for persistent/Markovian states where the long-run player's payoff depends on past states (inter-temporal payoff linkages). They want to know more about why this is the most useful/feasible direction. Let me think about this carefully.

Actually, re-reading the user's message, they're saying Interpretation #4 seems like the most feasible and useful result to pursue. Let me think about whether that's right and provide a thoughtful response.

Hmm, actually let me reconsider. The user said "it seems #4 is feasible as most useful result?" — they're asking whether Interpretation 4 is the most feasible and useful direction to pursue.
 
Looking at the different interpretations, Interpretation 1 with stationary ergodic Markov chains feels like the most natural extension but might just be a technical refinement, while Interpretation 4 genuinely adds economic substance by making payoffs depend on the history of states rather than just the current state. Interpretation 2 on Markov commitment strategies is important but quite involved, Interpretation 3 on autocorrelation identification is intriguing but might not yield clean results, and Interpretation 5 on mixing time bounds is purely technical. I'm inclined to think the user has a point about #4 being the most economically interesting direction, though I should consider whether it's truly the most tractable to pursue.

The challenge with #4 is that it fundamentally changes the problem structure — supermodularity becomes multi-dimensional, the optimal transport problem is no longer single-period, and the commitment type concept needs reconceptualization. But if the user is suggesting it's feasible and most useful, maybe there's a cleaner way to handle it that produces genuinely new economic insights and applications rather than just extending existing techniques. other interpretations (1, 2, 3, 5) are more "technical cleanup" — showing the existing result extends
3. #4 actually changes the economic content: it gives new conditions under which reputation works/fails

But feasibility is the question. Let me think about what would be needed...

For #4, the key challenge is that with payoffs like u₁(θ_t, θ_{t-1}, a_{1,t}, a_{2,t}), the optimal transport problem becomes a problem over pairs (θ_t, θ_{t-1}) → a_{1,t}. If we define the expanded state as ω_t = (θ_t, θ_{t-1}), then we're back in the original framework but with a larger state space. The distribution of ω_t is determined by the Markov transition kernel, which is stationary if the chain is stationary.

So if I redefine the signal as the pair (θ_t, θ_{t-1}), the signal distribution stays fixed across periods, the strategy maps from this pair to actions, and the existing framework applies directly. The key question is whether the long-run player actually observes both components — and she does, since she sees θ every period, so she knows both current and lagged states.

The real problem emerges when I think about what short-run players see. They only observe the marginal distribution over actions, not the underlying states. But the distribution of (θ_t, θ_{t-1}) from their perspective depends on θ_{t-1}, which was private information in the previous period. Unlike the i.i.d. case where the signal distribution is exogenous and known to everyone, here the signal distribution itself depends on unobserved private history. This breaks the direct applicability of the framework — the signal distribution is no longer exogenous.

Though actually, if the Markov chain is ergodic, the unconditional stationary distribution might still be well-defined and known to all players, which could restore some tractability.

The real tension is that the long-run player has access to the conditional distribution given the current state, while the short-run player doesn't — so there's an asymmetry in what each player knows about the state evolution. Interpretation #4 is actually quite rich because it forces me to grapple with this information structure rather than just tacking payoff dependence onto an otherwise standard framework. I should give the user a more honest answer about what would actually be required to make this work and why it's economically compelling despite the added complexity.
That's an interesting instinct, and I think it's partially right -- but let me push back a little and refine the picture, because #4 is actually harder than it first appears, precisely because it can't be cleanly separated from #1.

## Why #4 Seems Attractive

The appeal of #4 is that it's the most **economically substantive** extension. The others are essentially asking "does the same theorem hold under weaker technical assumptions?" while #4 asks a genuinely new economic question: **what happens when reputation payoffs have dynamic complementarities?** That produces new predictions, new applications, and a richer model -- the kind of result that would be a meaningful contribution rather than a technical footnote.

## The Hidden Difficulty

The problem is that once \(\theta_t\) is Markovian, you can't add payoff dependence on \(\theta_{t-1}\) without simultaneously confronting the fact that the **distribution of the "signal" is no longer exogenous**.

In the current paper, the signal \(y_0\) (or \(\theta\)) has a known, fixed distribution \(\rho\) each period. The optimal transport problem is:

\[
\text{OT}(\rho, \phi; \alpha_2): \max_{\gamma} \int u_1(y_0, a_1, \alpha_2)\, d\gamma \quad \text{s.t. marginals } \rho, \phi
\]

The fact that \(\rho\) is the **same exogenous object every period** is what makes the commitment type concept clean: type \(\omega_{s_1}\) plays the same \(s_1\) against the same signal distribution every period.

With Markov states, the distribution of \(\theta_t\) conditional on the private history is \(F(\cdot | \theta_{t-1})\), which the long-run player knows but short-run players don't. So:

- The "signal" distribution is **private information** (it depends on \(\theta_{t-1}\))
- A commitment type playing \(s_1(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\) induces a **different** action distribution each period depending on the unobserved \(\theta_{t-1}\)
- The OT problem changes every period in an unobservable way

This means #4 inherently requires solving #1 and #2 simultaneously.

## The Feasible Path: A "Lifted State" Approach

Here's why I think the suspicion that it's "possible but never done" is correct. The key insight would be:

**Redefine the expanded state as \(\tilde{\theta}_t = (\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\).** If the Markov chain is stationary and ergodic, then \(\tilde{\theta}_t\) has a **fixed stationary distribution** \(\tilde{\rho}\) on \(\Theta \times \Theta\). Now:

1. The "signal" is \(\tilde{\theta}_t\) with known distribution \(\tilde{\rho}\) -- exogenous again
2. The commitment strategy is \(s_1: \Theta \times \Theta \to \Delta(A_1)\)
3. The payoff is \(u_1(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_{1,t}, a_{2,t})\) -- naturally defined on the expanded state
4. The OT problem becomes \(\text{OT}(\tilde{\rho}, \phi; \alpha_2)\) with the new payoff -- **this is back in the paper's framework**

The catch is that \(\tilde{\theta}_t\) is not truly i.i.d. -- consecutive expanded states overlap (\(\tilde{\theta}_t\) and \(\tilde{\theta}_{t+1}\) share \(\theta_t\)). But this only affects the **statistical counting argument** (Lemma 2), not the OT characterization. And this is where Interpretation #5 comes in: the KL-divergence bound needs a mixing-time correction, but remains finite for ergodic chains.

## My Revised Assessment

The most feasible **and** useful result is actually **#4 implemented via the lifted-state approach, using #5's mixing-time correction for the statistical bound**. Concretely:

| Step | What to Do | Difficulty |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Redefine state as \(\tilde{\theta}_t = (\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\) with stationary distribution \(\tilde{\rho}\) | Easy (setup) |
| 2 | Reformulate confound-defeatingness via OT on the expanded state space | Moderate (the OT is higher-dimensional but structurally identical) |
| 3 | Characterize when expanded-state strategies are cyclically monotone / monotone | Moderate (new sufficient conditions needed -- supermodularity in \((\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_1)\)) |
| 4 | Adapt Lemma 2's counting bound for the Markov case | Hard (this is the core technical work -- needs ergodic theory for Markov chains rather than i.i.d. KL bounds) |
| 5 | Verify that martingale convergence (Lemma 3) still holds | Moderate (martingale arguments are robust, but the filtration changes) |

**Step 3 is where #4 gives the new economic content:** the supermodularity condition on \(u_1(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_1, a_2)\) in the expanded state gives new, testable predictions. For example, in the trust game: "reputation formation succeeds when the chef's payoff from high effort is *especially* high following a good state yesterday" -- a dynamic complementarity condition that has no analogue in the i.i.d. model.

**Step 4 is where #5 provides the technical engine:** the bound would look like \(\bar{T}(\eta, \mu_0, \tau_{\text{mix}}) \approx -2\log\mu_0(\omega_{s_1^*}) / (\eta^2 \cdot (1 - q))\), where \(q\) is the persistence parameter and \(1/(1-q)\) captures the mixing time inflation.

## Bottom Line

You're right that #4 is the most useful result. But its feasibility depends on recognizing that it's really **#4 + #5 together**, implemented via the lifted-state trick. The good news is that each piece has well-known analogues in probability theory and optimal transport, so the suspicion that it's "possible but never done" is well-founded -- it's a matter of carefully stitching together existing tools, not inventing new ones.

[Thinking] Now I see the full context. Daniel Luo, one of the paper's authors, is offering $500 to anyone who can figure out how to extend the main result (Theorem 1) to allow for persistent/Markovian states in under 5 hours. He says "something we suspect is possible but never did."

This is a very specific challenge. Let me think about what would actually constitute a winning answer — not just a research direction, but an actual proof sketch or argument that convincingly demonstrates the extension works.

The key question is: what exactly breaks in the proof of Theorem 1 when θ is Markovian rather than i.i.d., and can it be fixed?
 
Let me trace through the proof structure. Theorem 1 relies on two main lemmas: one establishing a statistical distinguishing bound using KL-divergence arguments when a commitment type exists, and another showing belief convergence. The critical issue is that both of these arguments depend heavily on the i.i.d. assumption for the state θ — the independence structure is baked into the likelihood ratio calculations and the martingale arguments used for belief dynamics. Now I'm thinking about how the i.i.d. assumption breaks down with Markov states—specifically, commitment types still play a fixed strategy mapping from the current state to actions each period, but the state distribution itself becomes path-dependent rather than stationary, which changes how beliefs about commitment types evolve over time. The long-run frequency of actions converges to a fixed marginal φ that short-run players can observe, even though period-by-period distributions fluctuate based on the unobserved state. Under the i.i.d. assumption, the joint signal distribution stays constant each period, but under the Markov structure it varies with the previous state. For the KL divergence bound, I need to count periods where the signal distribution under the commitment strategy differs from the equilibrium strategy, which behaves differently depending on whether we're in the i.i.d. or Markov setting.

The core problem is that under Markov dynamics, the optimal transport problem itself changes each period because the marginal distribution over signals depends on the previous state, whereas under i.i.d. it's identical every period. To address this, I'm considering a "lifted state" approach where I track both the current and previous state as a joint object, though even this doesn't fully resolve the issue since consecutive lifted states still overlap and aren't independent.

The real questions are whether I can still define a meaningful commitment strategy, run the statistical identification argument, and characterize confound-defeatingness through optimal transport. For the commitment strategy, a player would still follow a stationary function of the current (or current and lagged) state each period, even though the input distribution varies. For the confound-defeating property, the challenge is that the signal distribution now depends on the previous state, so I need the confound-defeating condition to hold not just for a single signal distribution but across all possible distributions that could arise from different state realizations.

The original optimal transport problem fixes the signal marginal as exogenous, but with Markov states, the signal distribution becomes endogenous and state-dependent. So I'd need to reformulate the OT problem to condition on the previous state, making the transport problem itself state-contingent. marginal over actions conditional on θ_{t-1}.

The confound-defeating property would need to hold for each possible θ_{t-1}. That is: for each θ_{t-1}, the joint distribution γ_{θ_{t-1}}(s*₁) over (θ_t, a₁) uniquely solves OT(F(·|θ_{t-1}), φ_{θ_{t-1}}(s*₁); α₂).

In the supermodular case, this reduces to: s*₁ is monotone for each conditional distribution F(·|θ_{t-1}). Since monotonicity of s*₁ is a property of the function s*₁ itself (not of the distribution), this is just the same condition — s*₁ monotone.

So the confound-defeating property extends pretty directly to the dynamic setting.

Now for the statistical identification part, which is trickier. Lemma 2 establishes that if I define H_t^η as the set of histories where the posterior probability of the equilibrium signal distribution versus the deviation signal distribution stays within η, then the expected number of periods outside this set is bounded. The proof relies on a likelihood ratio argument—under the deviation measure where the long-run player uses s*₁, the cumulative KL divergence between the two signal distributions is bounded by a finite quantity. The key insight is that the sum of KL divergences across time steps equals the overall divergence between the deviation measure and equilibrium measure, which is bounded by the negative log of the prior probability on the commitment type. This bound emerges from a deeper principle: the posterior probability of the commitment type follows a supermartingale under the equilibrium. The key insight is that this bound is model-free—it follows purely from Bayesian updating structure without assuming i.i.d. data, so Lemma 2 carries through as-is. For Lemma 3, the posterior beliefs form a martingale under the true measure, and by martingale convergence they converge almost surely to a limit concentrated on {ω_R, ω_{s*₁}}, which the identification argument then pins down further.

Now I'm checking whether the identification step still works under Markov states—specifically, whether different strategies s₁ ≠ s*₁ still induce different signal distributions even when both are played as functions of the same state θ_t. Under i.i.d. and Markov assumptions, different strategies generically produce different marginals over actions, so identification from signals still holds. With Markov states, there's an additional layer: even if unconditional marginals match, the conditional distributions given different past states can diverge, and since the unobserved state affects observed signals, the autocorrelation structure actually strengthens identification. This means Lemma 3 should carry through without much trouble. Now I'm turning to Lemma 1 and whether the confound-defeating property still applies when the signal distribution...

For the confound-defeating condition to work under Markov states, it needs to hold conditional on each possible previous state. Since the long-run player observes the state at each decision point, the one-shot deviation logic remains intact: whenever she deviates from the strategy and the confound-defeating property holds for that state's conditional distribution, a profitable deviation generating the same signals must exist. The critical requirement is that for each previous state, the joint distribution over current state and action induced by the strategy and the conditional state transition uniquely identifies the optimal transport problem.

In the supermodular case, this reduces to requiring the strategy to be monotone—a condition that's independent of the specific distribution. The extension succeeds because the KL divergence bound doesn't depend on state distributions but only on the prior probability of commitment types, belief convergence still holds through martingale arguments without requiring i.i.d. states, and the confound-defeating property remains generically satisfied since different commitment types induce different signal distributions, which is actually strengthened by the richer autocorrelation structure available under Markov dynamics.

The key new requirement is that confound-defeatingness must hold for each conditional distribution rather than just the marginal, though in the supermodular case this is automatic. Let me double-check the original proof to make sure I'm handling the commitment type's strategy correctly...

Actually, I need to think through how the signal distribution changes under Markov states. In the i.i.d. case, the public signal distribution stays constant across periods, but under Markov dynamics it depends on the unobserved state θ_{t-1}. This affects how I define η-confirmed best responses — the single-period condition from the original paper needs to account for how the signal distribution varies with the underlying state. the key insight is that short-run players don't observe θ_{t-1}, but they can infer it from the action history—and since the commitment type's strategy is deterministic in the state, the action sequence itself becomes informative about the state sequence. Under i.i.d. states this inference doesn't help much, but under Markov dynamics, past actions reveal past states which predict the current one, making the action sequence itself Markovian.

Now I need to check whether short-run players can statistically distinguish the equilibrium strategy from alternatives. The Markov structure actually helps here—the autocorrelation in actions provides extra identifying information beyond what's available under i.i.d.

Let me work through the proof of Theorem 1 more carefully under Markov states. First, I'll define the deviation measure Q where the rational long-run player commits to playing the equilibrium strategy s*₁(θ_t) in each period.

For the second step, I need to bound how many periods the observed history falls outside the distinguishing set H_t^η—where the probability distributions of the equilibrium and alternative strategies are sufficiently close. Under Q, the expected number of such periods is bounded by a function of η and the initial belief, which follows from the KL divergence accumulating over time. The chain rule for KL divergence decomposes the total divergence between Q and P over T periods into a sum of conditional KL divergences at each step, and since both distributions agree on commitment types with the rational type playing s*₁ under Q, the data processing inequality bounds this by -log μ₀(ω_{s*₁}), so Lemma 2 follows directly. For Lemma 3, I need to show the posterior converges Q-almost surely to a limit that puts probability 1 on the rational and s*₁-committed types, which requires ruling out convergence to other commitment types.

If the posterior puts positive weight on some alternative commitment type s₁ ≠ s*₁ in the limit, then the signal distributions under s₁ and s*₁ would have to be identical asymptotically—but under i.i.d. signals this is impossible unless s₁ is behaviorally indistinguishable from s*₁. The argument extends to Markov states because even though the signal distribution depends on the current state θ_t, the data generated under Q follows the distribution induced by s*₁ and θ_t, so any alternative type ω_{s₁} would need to generate the same observations, which fails unless they're behaviorally equivalent.

Since the Markov chain is ergodic, every state is visited infinitely often, so the signal distribution differences between s₁ and s*₁ appear repeatedly. The short-run players' posterior on θ_{t-1} integrates over these differences, and because the state space is visited frequently enough, they can eventually distinguish between the types.

Wait, but the short-run players don't directly observe θ_{t-1}—they only see the history h_t. So I need to think about the marginal signal distribution they actually observe, which averages over their posterior beliefs about the state. For two different commitment strategies s₁ and s*₁ to be distinguishable, their marginal signal distributions conditional on h_t must differ.

The key insight is that if the posterior has full support over possible states (which happens generically given the ergodic Markov chain and informative signals), then different strategies will induce different mixtures of signal distributions. And more directly, if the strategies differ and signals identify actions, then for at least some state, the distribution over next states must differ between the two strategies, making them observable in the long run.

Now I'm working through how Lemma 3 extends under ergodicity, and then turning to the confound-defeating property—specifically how it constrains the rational player's behavior at histories where the signal distribution closely matches the commitment distribution.

The key insight is that under Markov states, the confound-defeating condition must hold conditional on each state θ_{t-1}, since the long-run player observes the state and solves the optimal transport problem given that information. So I need s*₁ to be confound-defeating for every conditional distribution F(·|θ_{t-1}), meaning the commitment strategy uniquely solves the transport problem for each state.

In the supermodular case, monotonicity of s*₁ is sufficient and doesn't depend on the distribution itself. The front-loading argument remains the same, just using the bounds I've already established. The main changes are that commitment types now play state-dependent strategies s₁(θ_t) each period, and the stationary Markov structure with ergodic transitions replaces the static setup.

The confound-defeating property now requires that for any previous state θ_{t-1} and any type in B₀(s*₁), the joint distribution over current states and actions induced by s*₁ uniquely solves the optimal transport problem. This stronger condition ensures the result extends: if s*₁ is confound-defeating and not behaviorally confounded, then the player's payoff approaches V(s*₁) as the discount factor approaches one.

In the supermodular case, monotonicity of s*₁ becomes equivalent to confound-defeatingness for each conditional distribution, so the condition remains the same. The key realization is that the i.i.d. assumption carries much less weight than it initially seems—the statistical bounds are model-free, belief convergence only requires ergodicity rather than i.i.d., and the confound-defeating property is fundamentally a per-period condition that extends naturally through conditioning on the previous state.

But I need to be more careful here. There's a subtlety about how the commitment type's strategy interacts with the signal distribution across periods.

Under i.i.d. assumptions, the joint distribution of public signals stays constant each period. Under Markov state dynamics where the state itself becomes the signal, the distribution conditions on the previous state instead, creating a time-varying but state-dependent structure.

Short-run players never directly observe the underlying state, but they infer it from the sequence of public signals they see—each signal correlates with the current action, which in turn correlates with the current state. This means past signals implicitly reveal information about past states, allowing them to update beliefs about the current state.

Now I'm trying to pin down exactly what the equilibrium distribution should be in the proof—specifically, what distribution the short-run players' beliefs should follow given the commitment type's strategy.

The key insight is that under a Markov state process, the conditional signal distribution given history depends on the posterior belief about the current state, whereas under i.i.d. states, past signals are irrelevant. But this distinction doesn't actually change the KL divergence bound in Lemma 2—the bound still holds because we're comparing the same conditional distributions under both the equilibrium and the alternative strategy.

The extension to the Markov case requires three main adjustments: assuming ergodicity of the state chain, requiring confound-defeatingness to hold for each conditional distribution over signals given the previous state, and noting that in the supermodular case this reduces to just checking monotonicity. In fact, when the payoff is supermodular, monotonicity automatically ensures confound-defeatingness for any full-support distribution, so the condition is satisfied for each conditional distribution as long as it has full support.

But I need to be careful about how Lemma 1 applies under Markov states—there's a potential subtlety in the argument that I should work through more carefully.

The key issue is that when states are Markov, the signal distribution depends on the previous state θ_{t-1}, which the rational player observes. So when checking for profitable deviations at history h_t, I need to account for the fact that the player knows θ_{t-1} and is choosing an action that affects the signal distribution conditional on that state.

  contents: # First Parse: Extending "Marginal Reputation" to Persistent/Markovian States

**Date:** February 16, 2026, 8:40 PM
**Paper:** "Marginal Reputation" by Daniel Luo and Alexander Wolitzky (MIT, December 2024)
**Challenge:** Daniel Luo offers $500 to anyone who can figure out how to extend the main result to allow for persistent/Markovian states in <5 hours. He and his coauthor suspect it is possible but never carried it out.

---

## 1. Understanding the Paper

### 1.1 The Setting

A long-run player (player 1, discount factor δ) faces a sequence of myopic short-run opponents in a repeated game. Each period:

1. A **private signal** y₀ (or state θ) is drawn — the long-run player observes it, short-run players do not.
2. The long-run player chooses an action a₁ based on y₀.
3. Short-run players observe the **history of past actions** (the marginal over a₁) but **not** the history of signals.

The long-run player is either **rational** (type ωᴿ) or one of countably many **commitment types** ω_{s₁}, each of which plays a fixed strategy s₁: Y₀ → Δ(A₁) every period. The type is drawn once from a full-support prior μ₀ and is perfectly persistent.

### 1.2 The Core Problem

The long-run player's strategy s₁ maps signals to actions, but short-run players only see the **marginal distribution over actions**, not the conditioning. Two very different strategies can produce identical observable behavior:

- **Stackelberg strategy:** "Fight when I detect an attack" (conditional on signal)
- **Confounding strategy:** "Fight 50% of the time regardless" (unconditional)

Both produce the same action marginal. Standard reputation results (Fudenberg-Levine 1992, Gossner 2011) bound payoffs using "0-confirmed best responses," but in this partially-identified setting, the set of 0-confirmed best responses is so large that these bounds are **vacuous**.

### 1.3 The Main Result (Theorem 1)

**Statement:** If the Stackelberg strategy s₁* is **confound-defeating** and **not behaviorally confounded**, then:

$$\liminf_{\delta \to 1} \underline{U}_1(\delta) \geq V(s_1^*)$$

where V(s₁*) is the commitment payoff (payoff from playing s₁* against the least favorable best response).

**Confound-defeating** means: for any best response (α₀, α₂) ∈ B₀(s₁*), the joint distribution γ(α₀, s₁*) over (signal, action) is the **unique solution** to the optimal transport problem:

$$\text{OT}(\rho(\alpha_0), \phi(\alpha_0, s_1^*); \alpha_2): \max_{\gamma \in \Delta(Y_0 \times A_1)} \int u_1(y_0, a_1, \alpha_2)\, d\gamma$$

subject to the marginals being ρ(α₀) and φ(α₀, s₁*).

**Intuition:** If the Stackelberg strategy is the *only* rational way to produce the observed action marginal, then short-run players who observe the Stackelberg marginal must conclude the long-run player is playing the Stackelberg strategy — and best respond accordingly.

### 1.4 Characterization via Cyclical Monotonicity

The confound-defeating property is equivalent to **strict cyclical monotonicity** of supp(s₁*) in Y₀ × A₁ (Proposition 5, Corollary 1). This connects reputation theory to classical optimal transport theory (Rochet 1987, Santambrogio 2015).

### 1.5 The Supermodular Case (Proposition 7)

When u₁ is strictly supermodular in (y₀, a₁), confound-defeating simplifies to **monotonicity**: higher signal → weakly higher action. This yields clean results:

- **Deterrence game:** If fighting is relatively more appealing when an attack is detected (x + y < 1), the long-run player secures her Stackelberg payoff. If reversed (x + y > 1), she gets only her minmax payoff.
- **Trust game:** If min{w, z} > 0 (supermodular), Stackelberg payoff is secured. If max{w, z} < 0 (submodular), only minmax.
- **Signaling game:** A patient sender secures commitment payoff from any monotone strategy when the signaling cost is submodular.

### 1.6 Upper Bound (Proposition 6 / Corollary 3)

If μ₀(ωᴿ) → 1, the long-run player's payoff cannot exceed that from some cyclically monotone strategy. This provides a converse: reputation cannot help you commit to non-monotone strategies.

### 1.7 Extension to Behaviorally Confounded Strategies (Appendix A, Theorem 2)

When s₁* is behaviorally confounded, the result weakens to:

$$\liminf_{\delta \to 1} \underline{U}_1(\delta) \geq \beta V(s_1^*) + (1-\beta) V_0(s_1^*)$$

where β is the "salience" of s₁* — the minimum probability that the weight on s₁* exceeds the confounding threshold.

### 1.8 Communication Games (Section 6)

Characterizes when a communication mechanism s₁: Θ → Δ(R) is monotone w.r.t. some order: iff the bipartite graph G(s₁) is **acyclic and forbidden-triple-free** (Proposition 9). This gives a reputational foundation for Bayesian persuasion solutions.

---

## 2. The Critical Assumption: States are i.i.d.

Throughout the paper, the private signal/state θ is drawn **i.i.d. across periods**. This assumption is used in at least four places in the proof:

### 2.1 Commitment types are stationary
A commitment type plays s₁ every period. This is meaningful because the stage game is identical each period (same distribution of θ). With Markov states, a "commitment type" would need to be redefined.

### 2.2 The signal distribution ρ is exogenous and fixed
The OT problem OT(ρ, φ; α₂) has ρ as a known, fixed marginal. With Markov states, the distribution of θₜ depends on the unobserved θ_{t-1}, so ρ becomes private information.

### 2.3 The KL-divergence counting bound (Lemma 2)
The bound on "distinguishing periods" is:

$$\bar{T}(\eta, \mu_0) = \frac{-2\log\mu_0(\omega_{s_1^*})}{\eta^2}$$

This relies on the signal distribution being the same each period, so that KL divergences are additive across periods. With Markov states, per-period KL divergences are not i.i.d.

### 2.4 The martingale convergence argument (Lemma 3)
The posterior μₜ converges because the per-period likelihood ratios are i.i.d. With Markov states, they are dependent.

### 2.5 What Pei (2020) does differently
Pei studies the **perfectly persistent** case (θ drawn once, fixed forever) — the opposite extreme from i.i.d. He finds broadly similar supermodular/submodular distinctions but requires binary short-run player actions and conditions on the prior. The paper notes (footnote 9) that their Proposition 2 "is roughly consistent with Pei's results."

The Markov case interpolates between i.i.d. (Luo-Wolitzky) and perfectly persistent (Pei).

---

## 3. The Twitter Challenge

Daniel Luo's challenge: **"figure out how to extend the main result to allow for persistent/markovian states"** in under 5 hours. He suspects it is possible but he and Wolitzky never did it.

### 3.1 What "extend the main result" likely means
- **Theorem 1** (or its generalization Theorem 2) should hold when θₜ follows a Markov chain F(·|θ_{t-1}) rather than being i.i.d.
- The result should recover the i.i.d. case when F is independent of θ_{t-1}.
- Ideally, it should also shed light on the connection to Pei (2020) in the perfectly persistent limit.

### 3.2 What would "suffice" to win
A convincing proof sketch (not necessarily publication-ready) that:
1. States the extended theorem precisely.
2. Identifies where the i.i.d. assumption is used in the existing proof.
3. Shows how to modify each step for the Markov case.
4. Identifies what additional conditions (if any) are needed (e.g., ergodicity, mixing rate).

## 4. Five Interpretations Considered

We identified five ways to interpret "persistent/Markovian states":

| # | Interpretation | Core Idea |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Stationary ergodic Markov chain on θ | Most natural generalization; signal distribution becomes non-stationary from short-run players' perspective |
| 2 | Commitment types play Markov strategies | Strategy space expands to s₁(θₜ, θ_{t-1}); commitment type concept needs redefinition |
| 3 | Action autocorrelation as identification channel | Persistence creates temporal patterns in actions that help distinguish strategies |
| 4 | Payoffs depend on past states | u₁(θₜ, θ_{t-1}, a₁, a₂) with dynamic complementarities; new economic content |
| 5 | Mixing-time correction to statistical bounds | Replace i.i.d. KL bound with ergodic-theory bound; technical engine for the extension |

**Assessment:** The most promising approach combines elements of all five, but the key insight is what we call the **"lifted state" approach**.

---

## 5. The Proposed Solution Strategy: Lifted State Approach

### 5.1 The Core Idea

**Redefine the state as the pair** $\tilde{\theta}_t = (\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})$.

If the Markov chain is stationary and ergodic with transition kernel F, then:
- $\tilde{\theta}_t$ has a **fixed stationary distribution** $\tilde{\rho}$ on Θ × Θ
- A commitment type plays $s_1: \Theta \times \Theta \to \Delta(A_1)$ — a Markov strategy
- The payoff $u_1(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_{1,t}, a_{2,t})$ is naturally defined on the expanded state
- **The OT problem** becomes $\text{OT}(\tilde{\rho}, \phi; \alpha_2)$ with the expanded payoff — structurally identical to the paper's framework

### 5.2 What This Buys Us

- **The confound-defeating characterization** (Theorem 1) applies directly on the expanded state space
- **Cyclical monotonicity** characterizes confound-defeatingness on Θ × Θ × A₁
- **The supermodular case** gives new economic conditions: supermodularity of $u_1$ in $(\tilde{\theta}, a_1) = ((\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}), a_1)$ yields monotonicity in the expanded state

### 5.3 What Still Needs Work

The lifted-state trick handles the OT/confound-defeating part cleanly. The difficulty is in the **statistical/dynamic arguments**:

#### Step A: Counting bound (Lemma 2 adaptation)
- **Problem:** Consecutive expanded states $\tilde{\theta}_t$ and $\tilde{\theta}_{t+1}$ overlap (they share θₜ), so they are not independent.
- **Proposed fix:** Use the ergodic theorem for Markov chains. The expected number of distinguishing periods should be bounded by approximately:

$$\bar{T}(\eta, \mu_0, \tau_{\text{mix}}) \approx \frac{-2\log\mu_0(\omega_{s_1^*})}{\eta^2} \cdot \tau_{\text{mix}}$$

where $\tau_{\text{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the Markov chain. This is finite for ergodic chains and recovers the i.i.d. bound when F is independent of θ_{t-1}.

#### Step B: Martingale convergence (Lemma 3 adaptation)
- **Problem:** The likelihood ratios are no longer i.i.d.
- **Proposed fix:** The posterior μₜ is still a martingale (this is Bayesian updating, which doesn't require i.i.d.). The convergence argument (Lemma 9 in Appendix B) uses the martingale convergence theorem, which applies to any martingale. The key sub-argument that needs checking is whether $p_{Y_1}(\sigma_0^*, s_1 | h_t)$ and $p_{Y_1}(\sigma_0^*, s_1^* | h_t)$ still converge to the same limit — this should follow from ergodicity.

#### Step C: Uniformity over equilibria (Lemma 3's uniformity argument)
- **Problem:** The proof that $\hat{T}(\zeta)$ can be chosen independent of δ and the equilibrium uses compactness of the strategy space and continuity of measures. With Markov states, the strategy space is larger (Markov strategies rather than static strategies).
- **Proposed fix:** The space of Markov strategies $s_1: \Theta \times \Theta \to \Delta(A_1)$ is still a compact set (finite Θ). The compactness argument should go through with only notational changes.

### 5.4 Additional Conditions Needed

The extension should require:
1. **Ergodicity** of the Markov chain on Θ (ensures stationary distribution exists and mixing is finite)
2. **Finite mixing time** τ_mix (quantitative — enters the bound)
3. **Confound-defeatingness on the expanded state space** Θ × Θ (stronger than on Θ alone, since the strategy conditions on more information)

### 5.5 What the Extended Theorem Would Say

**Conjecture (Extended Theorem 1):** Let θₜ follow a stationary ergodic Markov chain with transition kernel F and stationary distribution π. Let $\tilde{\theta}_t = (\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})$ with stationary distribution $\tilde{\rho}$. If:
- The commitment type $\omega_{s_1^*}$ plays a Markov strategy $s_1^*: \Theta \times \Theta \to \Delta(A_1)$
- $s_1^*$ is confound-defeating on the expanded state space (i.e., γ(α₀, s₁*) uniquely solves $\text{OT}(\tilde{\rho}, \phi; \alpha_2)$ for all $(α₀, α₂) \in B_0(s_1^*)$)
- $s_1^*$ is not behaviorally confounded

Then:
$$\liminf_{\delta \to 1} \underline{U}_1(\delta) \geq V(s_1^*)$$

In the supermodular case, confound-defeating reduces to monotonicity of s₁* in the expanded state $(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})$.

---

## 6. Key Risks and Open Questions

1. **Is the lifted-state trick legitimate?** The main concern is that $\tilde{\theta}_t$ is not i.i.d. even though its marginal distribution is stationary. The proof needs to handle temporal dependence.

2. **Does the KL bound generalize cleanly?** The standard KL divergence bound for i.i.d. observations has well-known Markov analogues (e.g., via the spectral gap of the chain), but the exact constants matter for the result.

3. **Is the confound-defeating condition checkable?** On the expanded state space Θ × Θ, cyclic monotonicity is harder to verify. For the supermodular case, we need supermodularity in $(\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, a_1)$, which is a joint condition on the payoff function and the transition kernel.

4. **What happens as persistence → 1?** In the limit of perfect persistence, the mixing time diverges, the bound $\bar{T}$ diverges, and we should recover something like Pei's (2020) conditions (binary actions, prior conditions). Does the framework degrade gracefully?

5. **Can we handle order-k Markov chains?** The lifted-state trick generalizes: $\tilde{\theta}_t = (\theta_t, \theta_{t-1}, \ldots, \theta_{t-k})$. But the state space grows exponentially in k. Is there a cleaner approach for general Markov chains that doesn't blow up the state space?

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Write out the formal statement** of the extended theorem precisely, with all conditions.
2. **Trace through the proof of Theorem 1** step by step, marking each place where i.i.d. is used and writing the Markov replacement.
3. **Work out the KL bound** for Markov chains explicitly (this is the hardest technical step).
4. **Check the deterrence game** (Section 2.1) with Markov attacks as a concrete example.
5. **Write up a clean proof sketch** that could be sent to Luo as a response to the challenge.

*This document represents a first parse of the problem. The approach seems feasible but the details of the statistical arguments (Steps A-B above) require careful verification.*


[Tool result] Write

assistant:
The summary document has been written to `Feb16_840_firstParse.md`. It organizes everything from our conversation into seven sections:

1. **Understanding the paper** -- the setting, main result (Theorem 1), the confound-defeating property, the OT characterization, and all key supporting results
2. **The critical i.i.d. assumption** -- exactly where in the proof it is used (commitment stationarity, exogenous signal distribution, KL counting bound, martingale convergence) and how Pei (2020) handles the opposite extreme
3. **The Twitter challenge** -- what Luo is asking for and what would likely suffice
4. **The five interpretations** we discussed, with the assessment that they're interconnected
5. **The proposed lifted-state approach** -- the core strategy of redefining \(\tilde{\theta}_t = (\theta_t, \theta_{t-1})\), what it buys us, and the three specific proof steps that need modification (KL bound, martingale convergence, uniformity over equilibria)
6. **Key risks and open questions** -- five specific concerns including the perfectly-persistent limit and checkability
7. **Next steps** -- a concrete action plan for attempting the full proof sketch

To answer your question about what would suffice to win: I think Luo is looking for a **precise theorem statement plus a convincing proof sketch** showing how the four places where i.i.d. is used can each be handled in the Markov case. The lifted-state approach handles the OT/confound-defeating part almost for free; the real work is adapting Lemma 2's counting bound using ergodic theory for Markov chains. A clean write-up of that argument -- even without fully rigorous constants -- would likely qualify.
