user:
<user_query>
update my credentials on the @texPaper/ to show Kyle Elliott Mathewson, Faculty of Science, University of Alberta
</user_query>

assistant:
[Thinking] The user wants to update their credentials in a file or files within the `texPaper/` directory. They want to show:
- Name: Kyle Elliott Mathewson
- Affiliation: Faculty of Science, University of Alberta

Let me first search for files in the texPaper directory to see what's there, and then look for where credentials/author information might be stored.
I'll help you update your credentials in the texPaper directory. Let me first explore what files are there and find where the author information is located.
[Tool call] Glob
  glob_pattern: texPaper/**/*

[Tool result] Glob

assistant:
[Thinking] Good, there's a .tex file which is the main LaTeX document. Let me read it to find where the author credentials are defined.
[Tool call] Read
  path: /Users/kylemathewson/mathTest/texPaper/marginal_reputation_markov_extension.tex

[Tool result] Read

assistant:
[Thinking] I can see the LaTeX document. I need to find where the author credentials are listed and update them to show:
- Name: Kyle Elliott Mathewson
- Affiliation: Faculty of Science, University of Alberta

Looking at the document, I can see the author information appears on lines 83-88 in the title page section:

```
{\large
Kyle Mathewson\textsuperscript{1} \\[6pt]
with AI Collaborators:\\[4pt]
\textit{Claude Opus 4.6} --- Agents 840, 841, 852\\[2pt]
\textit{Claude Sonnet 4.5} --- Reader \& Parser
}
```

The user wants me to update it to show "Kyle Elliott Mathewson" (adding the middle name "Elliott") and add the affiliation "Faculty of Science, University of Alberta". 

Currently there's a superscript "1" which suggests there should be a footnote or affiliation listed somewhere, but I don't see any affiliation section below. I should add that as well.

Let me make the update:
I'll update your credentials in the LaTeX paper to show your full name and affiliation.

assistant:
[Thinking] Perfect! I've updated the author credentials to show:
1. The full name: "Kyle Elliott Mathewson" (added "Elliott")
2. Added the affiliation at the bottom of the title page: "Faculty of Science, University of Alberta"

The superscript "1" now properly references the affiliation line I added.
I've updated your credentials in the LaTeX paper. The changes include:

1. **Full name**: Changed "Kyle Mathewson" to "Kyle Elliott Mathewson"
2. **Affiliation**: Added "Faculty of Science, University of Alberta" as a footnote reference on the title page

The superscript "1" now properly references your affiliation which appears at the bottom of the title page.

user:
<user_query>
recompile
</user_query>

assistant:
[Thinking] The user wants to recompile the LaTeX document. I need to run the LaTeX compiler on the .tex file that I just edited. The file is located at `/Users/kylemathewson/mathTest/texPaper/marginal_reputation_markov_extension.tex`.

I should run pdflatex (or similar) to compile the document. Let me check what's in the texPaper directory first to understand the setup, then compile it.

For LaTeX documents, I typically need to run pdflatex multiple times to resolve references, table of contents, etc.
I'll recompile the LaTeX document for you.
[Tool call] Shell
  command: cd texPaper && pdflatex marginal_reputation_markov_extension.tex
  description: Compile LaTeX document to PDF
  block_until_ms: 15000

[Tool result] Shell

assistant:
[Thinking] Great! The compilation was successful. The PDF was generated with 26 pages. There are some warnings about duplicate identifiers and overfull hboxes, but these are minor formatting issues and the PDF was successfully created. Let me run pdflatex one more time to resolve cross-references and the table of contents properly.
Perfect! The document compiled successfully. Let me run it one more time to resolve all cross-references and ensure the table of contents is fully updated.
[Tool call] Shell
  command: cd texPaper && pdflatex marginal_reputation_markov_extension.tex

  block_until_ms: 15000

assistant:
[Thinking] Oops, the shell state persisted from the previous call, so we're already in the texPaper directory. Let me just run pdflatex again without the cd command.

  command: pdflatex marginal_reputation_markov_extension.tex

assistant:
[Thinking] Perfect! The document has been recompiled successfully. The PDF is ready with the updated credentials. The compilation was successful with 26 pages and 560,315 bytes. There are some minor warnings about duplicate identifiers and overfull hboxes, but these are typical LaTeX formatting issues that don't prevent the document from compiling correctly.

I should let the user know that the compilation is complete and the updated credentials are now in the PDF.
Perfect! The LaTeX document has been successfully recompiled. Your updated credentials are now in the PDF:

**Updated credentials:**
- **Name**: Kyle Elliott Mathewson
- **Affiliation**: Faculty of Science, University of Alberta

The PDF file `marginal_reputation_markov_extension.pdf` (26 pages, ~560KB) is ready in the `texPaper` directory with your full name and institutional affiliation properly displayed on the title page.
