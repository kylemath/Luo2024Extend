Save all the agent chat logs from the cursor files into .md files and add them to the repo in "promptHistory" folder

[Thinking] The user wants me to save all agent chat logs from cursor files into .md files and add them to a "promptHistory" folder in the repo.

First, I need to understand where cursor stores its chat logs. Based on the user_info, the workspace path is `/Users/kylemathewson/mathTest` and there's a terminals folder at `/Users/kylemathewson/.cursor/projects/Users-kylemathewson-mathTest/terminals`.

Cursor typically stores chat logs in the `.cursor` directory. The chat history is usually stored in a location like:
- `~/.cursor/chat/` or similar
- Or in the project-specific cursor folder

Let me search for cursor chat logs. They're typically stored in JSON format in the `.cursor` directory. I should:
1. First, look for where cursor stores chat logs
2. Find all chat log files
3. Convert them to markdown format
4. Save them in a "promptHistory" folder in the repo

Let me start by exploring the cursor directory structure to find chat logs.
I'll help you save all the agent chat logs from Cursor into markdown files in a "promptHistory" folder. Let me first explore where Cursor stores its chat logs.

[Thinking] Great! I can see there's an "agent-transcripts" folder in the cursor project directory. Let me explore that folder to see what's inside.
Perfect! I can see there's an `agent-transcripts` folder in the Cursor project directory. Let me explore what's inside.
